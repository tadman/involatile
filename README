 Data Exchange and Persistence Mechanism =============================================================================
 
Involatile aims to be a practical, intuitive framework for data exchange and
persistance between application layers and a back-end storage facility.

Modern web-based applications need an Object-Relational Mapping System that
is robust, flexible, high-performance, and multi-platform. To that end,
Involatile strives to support both Ruby and JavaScript bindings, as well
as MySQL, Postgres, SQLite and SimpleDB database platforms.
